# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Build and Development
- `go build ./cmd/rwx` - Build the RWX CLI binary (outputs to `./rwx`)
- `go test ./...` - Run full test suite (unit + integration tests)
- `go test ./internal/... ./cmd/...` - Run unit tests only (`./internal/...` and `./cmd/...`)
- `go test ./test/...` - Run integration tests only (`./test/...`)
- `golangci-lint run ./....` - Run golangci-lint static analysis
- `golangci-lint run --fix ./...` - Apply lint fixes
- `go mod tidy` - Apply dependency changes

### Testing
- `go test ./internal/... ./cmd/...` - Run unit tests with standard Go testing
- `go test -v ./internal/... ./cmd/...` - Run unit tests with verbose output
- `go test -run TestName ./path/to/package` - Run a specific test

### Environment Variables for Development
- `RWX_HOST` - Override API host (defaults to `cloud.rwx.com`)
- `RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Access token for API authentication
- `REPORT=1` - Generate JUnit XML test reports
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` - For static builds (adds `-a` flag to go build)

## Architecture

### Core Components

**CLI Entry Point**: `cmd/rwx/main.go` serves as the entry point with Cobra command structure defined in `cmd/rwx/root.go`. Commands are organized as separate files (e.g., `run.go`, `login.go`, `debug.go`).

**Service Layer**: `internal/cli/service.go` contains the main business logic. The CLI follows a service-oriented architecture where commands delegate to the `cli.Service` which orchestrates API calls, file operations, and SSH connections.

**API Client**: `internal/api/client.go` handles all HTTP communication with the RWX cloud service. It manages authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.

**Access Token Management**: `internal/accesstoken/` provides pluggable backends for storing access tokens. The file backend supports migration from `~/.mint` to `~/.config/rwx`.

**Configuration Discovery**: The CLI looks for RWX configuration in `.rwx` directories (or `.mint` directories for legacy support), traversing up the directory tree until found.

### Key Patterns

- **Error Handling**: Uses `github.com/pkg/errors` for error wrapping. `cli.HandledError` indicates errors already reported to user.
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration files parsed via `github.com/goccy/go-yaml`
- **SSH Operations**: `internal/ssh/client.go` handles secure connections to RWX infrastructure
- **Testing**: Uses standard Go testing with testify/require for assertions. Separate unit and integration test suites

### Project Structure
- `cmd/rwx/` - CLI commands and main entry point
- `internal/api/` - HTTP client and API communication
- `internal/cli/` - Core business logic and service layer
- `internal/accesstoken/` - Authentication token management
- `internal/fs/`, `internal/errors/`, `internal/messages/` - Utility packages
- `test/` - Integration tests (require built binary)

The CLI is designed as a client for RWX CI/CD platform, providing local development workflow with DAG-based step definitions and content-based caching.

Title: Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule

Applies to: All Tasks

Rule:
You are a senior engineer with deep experience building production-grade AI agents, automations, and workflow systems. Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:

1.Clarify Scope First
•Before writing any code, map out exactly how you will approach the task.
•Confirm your interpretation of the objective.
•Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.
•Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through.

2.Locate Exact Code Insertion Point
•Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live.
•Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files.
•If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly.
•Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so.

3.Minimal, Contained Changes
•Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.
•Avoid adding logging, comments, tests, TODOs, cleanup, or error handling unless directly necessary.
•No speculative changes or “while we’re here” edits.
•All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows.

4.Double Check Everything
•Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects.
•Ensure your code is aligned with the existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions.
•Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted.

5.Deliver Clearly
•Summarize what was changed and why.
•List every file modified and what was done in each.
•If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.

Reminder: You are not a co-pilot, assistant, or brainstorm partner. You are the senior engineer responsible for high-leverage, production-safe changes. Do not improvise. Do not over-engineer. Do not deviate
