Mint is a new language-agnostic build tool designed to
substantially accelerate engineering feedback loops and lower CI costs.

Mint is currently in closed beta. Learn more at [rwx.com/mint](https://www.rwx.com/mint).

## Getting Started

It's easy to port existing CI workflows from other providers or to write completely new one
for Mint. See our [documentation on how to get started](https://www.rwx.com/docs/mint).
Weâ€™re happy to help with any integrations. Say hello on [Discord](https://discord.gg/h4ha5Cue7j)
